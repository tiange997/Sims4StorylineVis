# Storyline Visualization for the Sims 4 Story

## Introduction

To be updated.

As for now, this web app supports visualizing the following information:

- Basic story character information (Sims created and Sim's important Contacts)
- Players' positions over time
- Players' events over time

(more details to be updated)

## Installation

Use the package manager [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/install) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/cli/add/) to install iStoryline.

```Shell
npm install i-storyline-js
```

or

```Shell
yarn add i-storyline-js
```

## Basic Usage of iStoryline framework

```JavaScript
import iStoryline from "i-storyline-js"
let iStoryliner = new iStoryline();

// generate storyline visualizations from the story script
let storyScriptUrl = './data/xml/Redcap.xml';

// graph can be drawed using any canvas or svg libraries
let graph = iStoryliner.load(storyScriptUrl);

// obtain the characters names
console.log(graph.characters);  // ['Red cap', 'Mother', 'Wolf', 'GrandMa']

// obtain the paths of the characters
console.log(graph.storylines);  // [[[x1, y1], [x2, y2], ...], ...]
```

-------- Below also need to be updated --------

## Basic Usage of iStoryline framework for the Sims 4

First using our python project to fetch the match data and convert it into a storyline json file. This will ultimately gives you match spatio-temporal data, general match information file, a killing info file and a DBSCAN result.
For this, check our [Lol_Storyline Data](https://github.com/tiange997/LoL-Storyline-Data) project and follow the instructions there.

You should put your visualization instance javascript file under the `/app/js` folder. You should also check the `/data/json/Match`
folder to see the data files that are used in the storyline visualisation.

To create a new match visualization instance, you can start copying one file from the `/app/js` folder, rename it and make changes as following:

```JavaScript

// adding match info to the storyline (fetched from Riot API)
const jsonRead = d3Fetch.json('../../data/json/xxx.json')

// adding killing info file generated by python
const jsonReadTwo = d3Fetch.json('../../data/json/xxx.json')

// adding DBSCAN result file generated by python
const jsonDBSCAN = d3Fetch.json('../../data/json/xxx.json')

// adding the match data generated by python for parsing
main('xxx.json');


```

Please then check and modify the webpack config file for new entry.

### Notes

- Drawing APIs are based on [canvas](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_canvas.asp) or [svg](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_svg.asp).
