# Storyline Visualization for the Sims 4 Story

## Introduction

As for now, this web app supports visualizing the following information:

- Characters icons/names
- Characters' events over time, with hovering tooltips showing event details
- Events filtered by types
- Characters' positions over time

## Pre-requisite for Installation

This visualization is based on Node.js and npm. Please make sure you have them installed on your machine.

## Installation Process

1. Install Node.js (>= 10.0)

2. Install dependencies `npm i`

3. Start the editor `npm run start`

4. Please visit [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

-------- Below also need to be updated --------

## Basic Usage of iStoryline framework for the Sims 4

First using our python project to fetch the match data and convert it into a storyline json file. This will ultimately gives you match spatio-temporal data, general match information file, a killing info file and a DBSCAN result.
For this, check our [Lol_Storyline Data](https://github.com/tiange997/LoL-Storyline-Data) project and follow the instructions there.

You should put your visualization instance javascript file under the `/app/js` folder. You should also check the `/data/json/Match`
folder to see the data files that are used in the storyline visualisation.

To create a new match visualization instance, you can start copying one file from the `/app/js` folder, rename it and make changes as following:

```JavaScript

// adding match info to the storyline (fetched from Riot API)
const jsonRead = d3Fetch.json('../../data/json/xxx.json')

// adding killing info file generated by python
const jsonReadTwo = d3Fetch.json('../../data/json/xxx.json')

// adding DBSCAN result file generated by python
const jsonDBSCAN = d3Fetch.json('../../data/json/xxx.json')

// adding the match data generated by python for parsing
main('xxx.json');


```

Please then check and modify the webpack config file for new entry.
